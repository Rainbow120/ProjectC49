           Camel
       </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Camels live in groups, with one male, many females, and their young calves or calf. They are animals that use their hooves.</li>
            <li>When there is no food or water, the camel uses the fat for energy, and the hump becomes small and soft.</li>
            <li>Since a camel lives in dry deserts, its waste contains very little water, so as to conserve the water in its body.
                 Even the water from the camel’s breath flows back into its mouth.</li>

                in the form of birds, rodents or other small animals. In captivity, they may get honey, eggs, fish, yams,
                 shrub leaves, or citrus fruits, etc.</li>
            <li>Giant panda cubs may stay with their mothers for up to three years. Then they leave her for a life of their own.</li>

            <li>Unlike other types of birds, pigeons produce a type of highly nutritious milk, that is produced by both genders to feed to
                their young.</li>
            <li>Several species of pigeons and doves are used as food, and probably any might be.
                 The powerful breast muscles of the family make excellent meat.</li>
